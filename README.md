Piet Mondrian, a Dutch painter, revolutionized 20th-century art with his abstract style centered around simple geometric elements. Here's a comprehensive overview of his paintings:

**From Early Landscapes to Abstraction:**

* Mondrian's early works (1890s-1900s) leaned towards naturalism and Impressionism, featuring Dutch landscapes, windmills, and churches.
* He then explored different styles like pointillism and Cubism, gradually simplifying forms and experimenting with color.

**Neo-Plasticism and the Grid:**

* Around 1917, Mondrian co-founded the De Stijl movement, later evolving his own visual language called Neo-Plasticism.
* This style characterized his mature works (1920s-40s):
    * **Limited Palette:** Black, white, primary colors (red, yellow, blue)
    * **Geometric Shapes:** Rectangles and squares
    * **Horizontal & Vertical Grids:** Black lines creating dynamic compositions
    * **Balance & Harmony:** Asymmetrical placement of contrasting colors and shapes

**Famous Mondrian Paintings:**

* **Broadway Boogie-Woogie:** Captures the vibrant energy of New York City with smaller squares and dynamic black lines.
* **Composition with Red, Blue, and Yellow:** A harmonious balance of primary colors set against white and black grid.
* **Victory Boogie-Woogie:** Vibrant squares with diagonal black lines, evoking a sense of movement and rhythm.
* **Tableau I:** Abstract squares and rectangles arranged in a lozenge shape, showcasing Neo-Plasticism's purity.

**Impact and Legacy:**

* Mondrian's style influenced various fields like fashion, furniture design, and architecture.
* His grids and color-blocking inspired artists like Jasper Johns and Ellsworth Kelly.
* His dedication to abstract purity established him as a pioneer of non-representational art.
